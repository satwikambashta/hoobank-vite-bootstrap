In the project directory, you can run:

npm create vite@latest

cd bank_tailwind
npm install
npm run dev
npm install -D tailwind css postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
